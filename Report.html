        <p> Introduction
            Over the past few weeks, I have been learning the basics of web development, coding, design, and the
            debugging process. This has been an exciting journey, and I have had my ups and downs. In this report, I
            will share my experience and reflect on my module experience. I will also discuss the development of my
            website over the term, focusing on both the technical and design aspects of the user interface (UI).

            Development Experience
            Learning web development has been an exciting experience, and I have enjoyed the challenge of coding and
            designing my website. I started by learning HTML, and CSS, which were the foundation of my website
            development. I spent several hours every day practicing coding and design, trying out different techniques
            and approaches until I was ok with the basics. As I progressed, I made little progress as the challenges
            were difficult despite attending every lesson has been tough, and I have no previous background in coding or
            HTML and CSS, and this has all been new.

        </p>

        <p>
            One of my biggest challenges was debugging my website and coding the layout and editing the right CSS file
            and also formatting it according to the grid. when something went wrong. I spent countless hours trying to
            identify and fix bugs and code to create the site which was frustrating at times. However, I learned that
            debugging is an essential part of the development process and that it helps to improve the quality of the
            website.

            Reflective Discussion of Module Experience
            Overall, my module experience has been great, and I have learned a lot about web development and design. The
            modules were well-structured, and the lecturers were knowledgeable and supportive. I appreciated the
            feedback I received from my tutors, which helped me to improve my coding and design skills.

            Design Decisions and UI
            When designing my website, I focused on creating a simple, clean, and intuitive user interface (UI). I chose
            a minimalist design, with a neutral color scheme and a simple font to make the website easy to navigate and
            read. A few sites helped me to understand the importance of design and how it can impact the user
            experience.

            Conclusion
            Learning web development and designing my website has been an exciting and challenging experience. I have
            learned a lot about coding, design, and the debugging process. I am proud of the website I have created and
            the progress I have made. I appreciate the support and guidance I received from my tutors, which helped me
            to achieve my goals.
